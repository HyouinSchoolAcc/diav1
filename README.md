"<Black Swan> ...I'm back. <Black Swan>  , Miss Himeko has something to tell you... There's good news, and bad news. <Black Swan> Which is why I must undertake Miss Himeko's request and bring both of you back to reality.  ... I'm glad to see that you're fine. Let us reach a safe place before speaking again. <speech>  Miss Black Swan, do you not intend to open some sort of... teleporter?"
2.wav
"<Acheron> Something's off. These traces are fresh. Someone just left the scene... Would this person have anything to do with what happened just now? <Black Swan> I cannot reach a conclusion with so few clues. <Acheron> Just listen to your gut — you were the one who said that... the Remembrance doesn't lie. <speech>  From the memories of these carcasses... that person was tall, and much stronger than an adult male. The method was clean and crisp, all one-strike kills — maybe a mercenary, or an assassin."
3.wav
"<Acheron> ... <Black Swan> After that, it's the end... <Acheron> Everyone, over there— <speech>  It seems like someone has been awaiting us. Ready to step into the spotlight now?"
4.wav
"<Sparkle> Alright, alright~ Just putting it out there... If you're ever in a pinch, remember I've got your back. I mean, who could resist a guy rocking spikes on his wings? <Sunday> There's no need. The malefactor has been exposed under THEIR radiant gaze and will soon fall by their own machinations. <Sunday> Should the transgressor fail to turn away from this path, THEIR sword will be honed, THEIR bow strung, causing the malevolence the perpetrator spreads to befall them. <speech>  When that time comes, the heathen will realize they are but a mere mortal, doomed to descend into the netherworld."

Never mind. Your introduction is not of my concern.

"<User> ...<Kurisu> I!<User> ?<Kurisu> H<Kurisu> a<Kurisu> v<Kurisu> e<Kurisu> to<Kurisu> go<Kurisu> sell<Kurisu>burgers.<Kurisu> Aaaaa!<User> Wait, seriously?<Acheron> <speech>YES! The accelerator completely died overnight! bruh this shit is actually so cringe.  REEEEEEE(sobs)"

Several notes:
1. 6.wav is terrible for both - single utterances is highly demonic, the normal one doesn't know how people sound when typing(mmight not be of a concern)
2. all sounds required a lot of times pressing generate- there's a bug to fix, but the successfully generated output sounds pretty good
3. speaker similarity is a bit off, but the guy/girl voice is often correct.
4. Honestly pretty happy with the result. The WER is still quite a bit off but it doesn't generate bad samples that often. A bit more RL could drastically improve quality
5. We might want more chinese in this for training, audience often are chinese.
